            <h3>Gun Laws</h3>
            <p> Purchasing a firearm in this day and age has became a lot more easier and faster. By putting higher age restrictions, we can hopefully prevent gun violence at a larger level. </p>

            <h3>Local Businesses</h3>
            <p> The business of America is business! We want to help out start-ups and local businesses as one of our policies. By doing this, it will start to break some of the larger businesses and promote newer and unique sellers. This will also help citizens get more jobs and help reduce inflation.</p>

        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Asia</h3>
            <p> Due to Asia becoming a major region of technological advances, we will work closely with our allies over there to help research better equipment for the us and them. Further more, by working more closely with them it will improve our relationship with them. As our relations becomes tighter we can then start making trade deals to those who need better equipment and research technology. </p>
